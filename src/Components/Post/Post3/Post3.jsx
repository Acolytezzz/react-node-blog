        The late stage of our relationship is where we truly put a stamp on our
        love story. We know, without a doubt, that we love each other deeply.
        Having navigated through all the hurdles and challenges, weâ€™ve emerged
        stronger and more connected than ever. This stage is the best for me
        because we have learned how to live together harmoniously, and
        disagreements have become rare.
